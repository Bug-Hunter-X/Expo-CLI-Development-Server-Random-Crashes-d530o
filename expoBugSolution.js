//Improved logging to capture more context before the crash. Consider using a global error handler.

// expoBugSolution.js

//If using a specific library that may be causing conflicts, consider adding more specific logging around those calls.

// Example using console.error for more verbose error handling:

function myFunction() {
  try {
    // Your code that might cause the error
    // ...
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error in myFunction:', error);
  }
}

//You might also add logs around any system-intensive operations within your app, to check for resource issues that might cause crashes.
