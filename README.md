# Expo CLI Development Server Random Crashes

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo CLI development server randomly crashes without providing any error messages. The app continues to run on the device or simulator, but the Metro bundler becomes unresponsive and requires a manual restart.

## Bug Description

The Expo development server intermittently crashes without any clear indication in the terminal. This makes debugging difficult and disrupts the development workflow. The app itself remains functional, but the developer loses access to hot reloading and other development server features. 

## Steps to Reproduce

The exact cause of this bug seems to be unpredictable.  Steps to reproduce have not been reliably established, as the crash appears to be random.  Further investigation may involve monitoring system resources and logs.

## Solution

Unfortunately, there is no single definitive solution.   The proposed solution focuses on improving monitoring and logging to help identify the root cause in specific instances.  Additional investigation of dependencies or resource constraints may also be necessary.
